Programming is hard. One of the hardest things is deciding the “shape” of the program, or library, or system, you want to make. It can seem like a way to proceed is to start writing code, and make decisions later. But there is a better way! If you instead think about configuration data, and write only enough code to give that data form, your program will be much more flexible.
